# Link popup selector

_Link popup selector_ works similarly as [Link selector][link-selector]. It can
be used for url extraction and site navigation. The only difference is that
_Link popup selector_ should be used when clicking on a link the site opens a new
window (popup) instead of loading the URL in the same tab or opening it in a
new tab. This selector will catch the popup creation event and extract the URL.
If the site creates a visual popup but not a real window then you should try
[Element click selector][element-click-selector]

Note! when selecting these link elements you can move the mouse over the
element and press "S" to select it to prevent it from opening a popup.

## Use cases

See [Link selector][link-selector] use cases.
